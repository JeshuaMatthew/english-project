## Thesis ðŸ“œ

**Cybersecurity** is important in the digital world. This is because it stops **unauthorized people** (people who shouldn't have access) from getting users' **sensitive information**.

## Arguments ðŸ—£ðŸ“¢

1.  Without **cybersecurity**, users cannot use digital services that need their **sensitive data**, like online shopping. If online shop companies don't use **cybersecurity** for their services, users' **sensitive data** can be stolen and used wrongly by irresponsible people. Because of this, users may not want to give their **sensitive data**, and use the app services.

2.  **Cybersecurity** gives users **privacy** online. Users can choose to share information only with certain people. For example, a company can create a special communication app that only its employees have access to. This allows all company members to share information to each other in a digital space, away from the reach of uninvited entities.

3.  **Cybersecurity** ensures applications work correctly. For example, if an application does not employ **cybersecurity**, an unwanted group or entity could change how the app functions and looks without the developersâ€™ permission. This means users might not be able to use the app's services, or if severe enough may damage their devices.

4.  Lastly, in the digital age, governments use technology to store and manage people's data. This helps make administrative processes faster. **Cybersecurity** makes this possible. It protects the country from **cyber attacks** and ensures that **unauthorized people** cannot access people's **sensitive data**.

## Conclusion ðŸ‘‡

In conclusion, **cybersecurity** is very important in this digital age, because it ensures only the select few people have access to certain **sensitive information**.
